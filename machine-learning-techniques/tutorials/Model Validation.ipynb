    "## Generated dataset\n",
    "SciKit learn offers a functions to generate datasets for testing machine learning algorithms. We will use the dataset generated by `make_classification` to test our models. Some parameters control the number of samples, the number of features, the number of classes and the number of informative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights parameter allows to control the **class imbalance**. Class imbalance is a common problem in machine learning. It occurs when the number of samples in one class is **much higher** than the number of samples in the other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suprisingly, many phenomena in the real world are characterized by class imbalance. For example, in fraud detection, the number of fraudulent transactions is much lower than the number of normal transactions. In medical diagnosis, the number of healthy patients is much higher than the number of sick patients. In this case, the model will get biased towards the majority class. A so-called **majority class classifier** can achieve a high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class all the time. Due to the class imbalance, this is a very high accuracy, but the model is **useless**. Other evaluation measures like precision, recall and f-measure correctly assess the quality of the model. So, it is important to detect class imbalance and to use appropriate techniques to deal with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will generate a dataset with 80% of samples in the first class and 20% of samples in the second class. The class_sep parameter controls the ratio of the standard deviation of the clusters to the standard deviation of the data points within the clusters. The higher the value, the more the clusters are separated. The **more difficult** the classification problem will be.\n",
    "\n",

    "### K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "K-fold cross-validation is a technique where the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k − 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds can then be averaged to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method over repeated random sub-sampling is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is as follows:\n",
    "* Shuffle the dataset randomly.\n",
    "* Split the dataset into $k$ groups\n",
    "* For each of the $k$ groups:\n",
    "    * Take a group as a holdout validation set\n",
    "    * Combine the remaining $k-1$ groups as a training data set\n",
    "    * Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the validation set\n",
    "    * Retain the evaluation score and discard the model\n",
    "    * Repeat for the next group\n",
    "* The performance score is the average of the values computed in the loop\n",
    "* The final model is evaluated on the test set\n",

    "### Group K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GroupKFold` function is a variation of the `KFold` function. The only difference is that the `GroupKFold` function makes sure that the same group is not in both the training and validation sets. This is useful when the observations are not independent of each other. For example, if we have a dataset of patients, and we want to predict whether a patient will have a heart attack, we can use the `GroupKFold` function to make sure that the **same patient** is not in both the training and validation sets. This is because we want to make sure that the model is not using information from the validation set to make predictions on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a new and very simple dataset to demonstrate this. This dataset has an extra column called `group`. The `group` column is just a random number between 0 and 4. We will use the `GroupKFold` function to make sure that the same group is not in both the training and validation sets."
